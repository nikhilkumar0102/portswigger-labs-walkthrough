The website is using this query in the backend when you choose a product category like "Gifts":

```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```
This means: `Show only products` where: The category is  `Gifts` AND the released flag is 1 `(which means it's public/visible)`

- Your goal:
-- üëâ Trick this query to also show unreleased products (those with released = 0), using SQL Injection.

# üß™ Step-by-Step Explanation

## üîç Step 1: Find where to inject

On the website, you might see a URL like this when you click a product category:
```
https://example.com/filter?category=Gifts
```

- This means the website is likely running a query like:

```
sql: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1;
```

## üß® Step 2: Inject the Payload

- Now, try replacing Gifts in the URL with this input:

```
1' OR 1=1--
```
- What are we doing here?

  - `1'`  This closes the original input value in the SQL query.

  - `OR 1=1 ` This is a logical condition that is always true. It says: ‚ÄúIf the first part fails, just show everything where 1 equals 1 (which is always true).‚Äù

  - `--` This is a SQL comment operator. It tells the database to ignore the rest of the query that might cause errors or prevent the injection from working (like AND released = 1).

- Execue the payload.

- We can see all the data i.e. the Gifts present which shows that it is vulnerable to sql injection.
